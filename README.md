<h2>The Theory</h2>

What we have here is an extension that will serve up 50% of users to one theme, and 50% of users to another theme - using cookies.

In the admin section we have the ability to add a specific Google Analytics tracking code to each of these themes.

This extension also retains the master Google Analytics account details.
